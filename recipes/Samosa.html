            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon,
                2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, finely chopped,
                ½ cup frozen peas
            </li>
            <li>
                2 (14.1 ounce) packages double-crust pie crusts, thawed,
                2 large egg whites, beaten, or as needed
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
                    medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a large bowl;
                    mash coarsely, then set aside.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, coriander seed, curry
                    powder, ginger, salt, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon in hot oil until onion
                    is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in tomatoes and peas.
                    Pour into coarsely mashed potatoes and mix until thoroughly combined. Cool filling completely.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cut each pie crust into 8 equal triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; fold
                    corners over filling to create a triangle-shaped hat. Pinch dough together to form a seal. Brush
                    beaten egg whites over each samosa and arrange on baking sheets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>
