    <h2>Ingredients and Steps
        <ul>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons ghee or oil,
                2 pounds carrots, grated
            </li>
            <li>
                1 ½ quarts whole milk,
                2 cups white sugar,
                ½ cup raisins or sultanas
            </li>
            <li>
                1 ½ teaspoons ground cardamom,
                1 pinch saffron threads,
                8 tablespoons chopped pistachio nuts
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat and add carrots. Cook and stir briefly, about 3 minutes.
                Pour in milk and increase heat; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Reduce
                heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered, and stirring occasionally until moisture evaporates, about 1
                hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring carrot mixture back to a boil; add sugar, raisins, cardamom, and saffron. Cook and stir until
                mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ladle carrot halwa into 8 individual serving dishes. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon pistachios.
                Serve warm or chill before serving.
